This is a sample project to show how to customize a react app.

In this lesson, when the word customize is used is for refering to how to organize the projects files in folders.

for simple projects just create a Components folder inside the src folder.

```customizing-example/src/components```

Then we created the components: 
- Nav.js
- Promo.js
- Intro1.js
- Intro2.js
- Intro3.js
- Footer.js
